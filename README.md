# WM8731-driver-LL
Mutable Instruments WM8731 codec driver adopted for use with STM HAL-LL libraries

This driver was adopted by an STM32 newbie and has not yet been verified to work in hardware, though it does compile.
Be warned: free as in speech, free as in beer, also free as in puppies.

Suggestions and forks are welcomed.
